I'm an **Analytics Engineer** 🇺🇦, currently diving deep into **consultancy** 🌍. After transitioning from a background in **energy engineering** ⚡, I now focus on **data analytics**, **ETL**, and **machine learning** 🧠. When I'm not working on exciting projects, you can find me creating **data courses** on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ion_lab) where I create **data courses** and tutorials to help others learn and grow in this exciting field.
In addition, I study **AI & ML** at the **University of London** 🎓
