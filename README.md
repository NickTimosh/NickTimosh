# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nikita!

Iâ€™m an Analytics Engineer with a passion for building useful data products for real-world impact. 

I began working with data in 2019, conducting data analysis and forecasting in the Energy and Climate sector for clients such as the World Bank, IFC, EBRD, KfW, and others.

In 2022, I transitioned fully into the tech field, diving deeper into data engineering and, more recently, exploring AI/ML applications to bring even more value to data-driven solutions.
